# Scratch-3DS
A W.I.P. runtime made in C++ aimed to bring any Scratch 3 project over to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.

## Controls
![Controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NateXS/Scratch-3DS/refs/heads/main/scratch%203ds%20controls.png)
To use the mouse you must enter mouse mode by holding L. Use the D-pad to move the mouse, and press R to click.

### Other Plaforms

All controllers on all other platforms use the same control scheme.

## Unique Features

### 3DS Screen modes
- Any un-edited scratch project will be displayed on the Top Screen only.
- If using a modded Scratch client like Turbowarp, you can go into the projects' Advanced Settings and change the resolution.
- - Setting it to `400x480` will enable both the top and bottom screen.
- - Setting it to `320x240` will enable only the Bottom screen.
- - Setting it to `400x240` will make the project perfectly fit to the top screen.
- - NOTE: make sure to click `Store Settings In Project` on Turbowarp to properly apply the settings.

### Wii U Screen Modes
- Currently, projects display exactly the same on both the TV and the Gamepad, and there's no way to change Screen modes.

### Framerate
- When using a modded Scratch client like Turbowarp, you can enable the `60 FPS (Custom FPS)` advanced option, and change the FPS to any value.

### Differently Implemented Blocks
- The `Username` block returns the 3DS's nickname, and the Wii U's current Mii name.
- The `Touching __?` block uses simpler box collision, which may lead to projects working incorrectly.
- The `Stop 'All'` block brings you back to the Homebrew menu.

## Limitations
As this is in a very W.I.P state, you will encounter many bugs, crashes, and things that will just not work. 

**List of known limitations:**
- Sound is not yet implemented
- Performance on old 3DS starts to tank with many blocks running
- There is no vector/svg sprite rendering. Images will only render if converted to bitmap beforehand, otherwise the sprite will show as a black square
- Images will only work if it's in .png or .jpg format
- If you have a bunch of large images, some may not load
- Images cannot be over 1024x1024 in resolution
- Some images may appear 'fuzzy' looking or have noticable inconsistencies
- Extensions (eg: pen and music extensions) are not yet supported
- Some blocks may lead to crashing/unintended behavior (please open an issue if you know a block that's causing problems)


## Unimplimented blocks
- All say and think blocks
- All* Costume Effects
- - *`Ghost` Costume Effect is supported.
- Cloud variables
- Show/hide variable | Show/hide list
- When backdrop switches to
- When this sprite clicked
- When loudness > ___
- All Color touching blocks
- Set drag mode
- Loudness

## Roadmap / to-do list
- Bug fixing and Scratch Parity
- Stereoscopic 3D support for 3DS
- Get all blocks working
- Pen support
- Cloud variables
- Ability to remap controls
- Audio support
- Turbowarp extensions

## Installation
There are 2 methods to install the runtime.
- Download the release (easy)
- Build the file yourself (harder)

### Get up and running for 3DS

Download the .3dsx file in the Releases tab

- Place the .3dsx file in the `3ds/` folder of your 3DS SD card, along with any Scratch projects you want to run.
- Note: Scratch-3DS is also on Universal Updater, so you can just download it there and keep it updated that way.

Then it should be as simple as opening the homebrew launcher on your 3DS and running the app.

### Get up and running for Wii U
Download the .zip file in the Releases tab.

Unzip the file in your `sdcard:/wiiu/apps/` folder.

Place the scratch project you want to run inside this folder as well.
- The Scratch project MUST be named `project.sb3`, all lowercase.

Then it should be as simple as opening the app on your Wii U!


### Building

In order to embed a Scratch project in the executable, you'll need to compile the source code.

For 3DS and Wii U, you will need to have Devkitpro's SDKs installed.
- For the 3DS you will need the DevkitARM toolchain and libctru.
- For the Wii U you will need the DevkitPPC toolchain, WUT, all SDL2-wiiu libraries, and libromfs-wiiu.

- Devkitpro's install instructions are available at : https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started

Download the source code from the releases tab and unzip it.

Make a `romfs` folder inside the unzipped source code and put the Scratch project inside of that.
- The Scratch project MUST be named `project.sb3`, all lowercase.
- For faster load times/less limitations, you can also unzip the sb3 project file and put the contents into a new folder called `project`.

If you would like to change the name of the app or any other information you can edit one of the Makefiles.
- For the 3DS you need to edit `Makefile_3ds` and change `APP_TITLE`, `APP_DESCRIPTION` and `APP_AUTHOR` to whatever you please.
- For the Wii U you need to edit `Makefile_wiiu` and change `APP_NAME`, `APP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION`, `APP_LONG_DESCRIPTION` and `APP_AUTHOR` to whatever you please.

Then it should be as simple as running `make` in the source code folder.
